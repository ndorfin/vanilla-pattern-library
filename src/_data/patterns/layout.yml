example:
  width: 500
  height: 300
  code: |-
    <div class="layout">
      <img src="https://placehold.co/600x600/000000/FFFFFF/webp" alt="Item 1">
      <img src="https://placehold.co/600x600/000000/FFFFFF/webp" alt="Item 2">
      <img src="https://placehold.co/600x600/000000/FFFFFF/webp" alt="Item 3">
    </div>
tests:
  - layout-of-cards
notes: |-
  - The minimum width of any column is 200 pixels. Make sure your content works at this small size.
  - The number of items is determined by the number of child elements added to the `.layout` element.
  - All layouts default to a single column at smaller screen sizes
  - Choose the number of columns based on the fixed number of items. e.g. 4-columns for 4, 8, 12, etc. items.
  - Avoid having 'orphaned' items in these layouts, i.e. one item on a row in a multi-column layout. 2 or more items in a row is fine, but they'll be left-aligned by default.
  - For tricky numbers of items, e.g. 7, then use a 4-column layout, rather than a 3-column layout.
  - 4-column layouts will switch to 2-column layouts at intermediate breakpoints.
  - When adding content such as [Cards](../card/) to layouts:
    - add them as direct children of the `.layout` element.
    - make sure they share the same number of content items per card. e.g. all have a heading, content, and call-to-action element.
    - make sure all Product and Image cards have the same ratio-sized images (This doesn't matter so much in Plain cards).

    id: columns-2
    name: 'Columns: 2'
    description: |-
      A grid layout of 2 columns, with more dedicated space for items at larger screen sizes.
    notes: |-
      - Even-numbered column layouts with 4 or more columns will switch to this 2-column layout at intermediate breakpoints.
      - This layout is ideal for an even number of items that need more space per item.
    example:
      width: 500
      code: |-
        <div class="layout" data-columns="2">
          <img src="https://placehold.co/600x600/000000/FFFFFF/webp" alt="Item 1">
          <img src="https://placehold.co/600x600/000000/FFFFFF/webp" alt="Item 2">
          <img src="https://placehold.co/600x600/000000/FFFFFF/webp" alt="Item 3">
          <img src="https://placehold.co/600x600/000000/FFFFFF/webp" alt="Item 4">
        </div>
  -
    id: columns-3
    name: 'Columns: 3'
    description: |-
      A grid layout of 3 columns, with less dedicated space for items at larger screen sizes.
    notes: |-
      - As soon as space allows (large screen sizes) this layout will switch to 3 columns from the default single column.
      - This layout is ideal for items numbering 3, 5, 6, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, and so on.
    example:
      width: 750
      code: |-
        <div class="layout" data-columns="3">
          <img src="https://placehold.co/600x600/000000/FFFFFF/webp" alt="Item 1">
          <img src="https://placehold.co/600x600/000000/FFFFFF/webp" alt="Item 2">
          <img src="https://placehold.co/600x600/000000/FFFFFF/webp" alt="Item 3">
          <img src="https://placehold.co/600x600/000000/FFFFFF/webp" alt="Item 4">
          <img src="https://placehold.co/600x600/000000/FFFFFF/webp" alt="Item 5">
          <img src="https://placehold.co/600x600/000000/FFFFFF/webp" alt="Item 6">
        </div>

    id: columns-4
    name: 'Columns: 4'
    description: |-
      A grid layout of 4 columns, with the smallest dedicated space for items at larger screen sizes.
    notes: |-
      - As soon as space allows (intermediate breakpoints) this layout will switch to 2 columns from the default single column.
      - At larger breakpoints it will jump up to 4 columns.
      - This layout is ideal for items numbering 4, 7, 8, 11, 12, 16, and so on.
    example:
      code: |-
        <div class="layout" data-columns="4">
          <img src="https://placehold.co/600x600/000000/FFFFFF/webp" alt="Item 1">
          <img src="https://placehold.co/600x600/000000/FFFFFF/webp" alt="Item 2">
          <img src="https://placehold.co/600x600/000000/FFFFFF/webp" alt="Item 3">
          <img src="https://placehold.co/600x600/000000/FFFFFF/webp" alt="Item 4">
          <img src="https://placehold.co/600x600/000000/FFFFFF/webp" alt="Item 5">
