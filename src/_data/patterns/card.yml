notes: |-
  - A card is comprised of (at most) 4 distinct sections:
    1. A banner image (using the `<picture>` element)
    2. A heading (using a [block-level heading](../heading/#variant_scheme-block) or smaller)
    3. A content block that can hold arbitrary content
    4. A Call-to-action element (if the card is 'interactive' - see below)
  - The Image and Product card variants can be made interactive, by using the anchor element (`<a>`) with the usual attributes.
  - An 'interactive' card MUST NOT have any anchors inside its content - this will break the HTML used to construct these types of cards.
  - Cards are intended to be used in a 2-4 column [layout](../layout/).
  - Cards are intended to match their peers when it comes to image sizes/ratios, and number of distinct sections.
variants:
  -
    id: mode-image
    name: 'Mode: Image'
    description: |-
      A borderless card that prioritises showing off an image
    example:
      code: |-
        <div class="card" data-mode="image">
          <picture>
            <source srcset="https://placehold.co/800x267/333333/CCFFFF/webp" media="(min-width: 400px)" type="image/webp">
            <img src="https://placehold.co/600x200/000000/FFFFFF/webp" width="300" height="100" alt>
          </picture>
          <div class="content">
            <p>…content goes here…</p>
            <p>And here’s <a href="#">a link</a>.</p> 
          </div>
        </div>
    notes: |-
      - The only mandatory section in this card variant is the `<picture>` element. Using this setup in a [layout](../layout/) will allow you to create tiles of images.
  -
    id: mode-product
    name: 'Mode: Product'
    description: |-
      An interactive card that insets the image and provides space for a call-to-action link.
    notes: |-
      This card **MUST NOT** contain any links or buttons in its content, as the whole card is meant to be interactive.
    example:
      code: |-
        <a class="card" href="#" data-mode="product">
          <picture>
            <source srcset="https://placehold.co/800x267/333333/CCFFFF/webp" media="(min-width: 400px)" type="image/webp">
            <img src="https://placehold.co/600x200/000000/FFFFFF/webp" width="300" height="100" alt>
          </picture>
          <div class="content">
            <p>…content goes here…</p>
          </div>
          <div class="call-to-action">
            Get a quote
          </div>
        </a>
  -
    id: mode-plain
    name: 'Mode: plain'
    description: |-
      Removes the border and reduces the large spacing for a default card.
    notes: |-
      - It's up to you to include whatever images you want, and their sizes
      - If you do use an image, please provide a double-resolution source by default
      - This card variant doesn't require equally-sized banner images. Smaller images will align themselves to the bottom of their row when used in a [layout](../layout/).
      - These cards work great with [block-level headings](../heading/#variant_mode-icon-above) that use icons above them
      - These cards don't have a background colour set, so avoid using these in inverted-themed [containers](../container/).
    example:
      code: |-
        <div class="card" data-mode="plain">
          <h4 class="heading" data-scheme="block" data-icon="stars" data-mode="icon-above">
            All star support
          </h4>
          <div class="content">
            <p>
              <img src="https://placehold.co/400x400/000000/FFFFFF/webp" width="200" height="200" alt>
            </p>
            <p>…content goes here…</p>
            <p>And here’s <a href="#">a link</a>.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
