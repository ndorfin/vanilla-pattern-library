      About us
    </h3>
notes: |-
  - Even though the design sources mention heading levels (1-6), this has no bearing on the `<h1>` to `<h6>` elements.
  - Heading levels 1 and 2 (`<h1>`, `<h2>`) are reserved for naming the site, and the logical section of the site (or page construct) respectively.
  - All heading schemes mentioned below should however be interchangeable with the `<h1>` to `<h6>` elements, and other blocks of text.

  -
    id: scheme-page
    name: 'Scheme: Page-level'
    description: |-
      This heading describes and introduces the entire page
    notes: |-
      - Use the attribute: `data-scheme="page"`.
      - This heading can only be used once in a page
    example:
      code: |-
        <h3 class="heading" data-scheme="page">
          About us
        </h3>
  -
    id: scheme-section
    name: 'Scheme: Section-level'
    description: |-
      Introduce a section of a page
    notes: |-
      - Use the attribute: `data-scheme="section"`.
      - This heading can be used several times in a page
    example:
      code: |-
        <h4 class="heading" data-scheme="section">
          Meet the team
        </h4>
  -
    id: scheme-block
    name: 'Scheme: Block-level'
    description: |-
      Introduce a subsection of a section, or block.
    notes: |-
      - Use the attribute: `data-scheme="block"`.
      - This heading can be used several times in a section
    example:
      code: |-
        <h5 class="heading" data-scheme="block">
          Your support team
        </h5>
  -
    id: scheme-paragraph
    name: 'Scheme: Paragraph-level'
    description: |-
      Introduce a paragraph, or break a block up into further logical chunks.
    notes: |-
      - Use the attribute: `data-scheme="paragraph"`.
      - This heading can be used several times in a block of content.
    example:
      code: |-
        <h6 class="heading" data-scheme="paragraph">
          Harry, the support pup.
        </h5>
  -
    id: variant-uppercase
    name: 'Variant: Uppercase'
    description: |-
      Sometimes a little oomph is required. Use this `data-variant`, while retaining sensible content.
    notes: |-
      - Use the attribute: `data-variant="uppercase"`.
      - You can use this variant interchangeably with the schemes above
      - Make sure to keep the actual content sentence case (as per the example). Uppercase content will be spelled out in screenreaders, as if it was an acronym.
    example:
      code: |-
        <h6 class="heading" data-scheme="paragraph" data-variant="uppercase">
          Harry, the support pup.
        </h5>
  -
    id: mode-icon-before
    name: 'Mode: Icon before'
    description: |-
      The block-level heading scheme supports icons before its content
    notes: |-
      - As with other icons, make sure you specify the correct `data-mode` and then specify which icon you'd like by using `data-icon`.
      - This only works on block-level headings
      - Icons are only supported before the text content
    example:
      code: |-
        <h4 class="heading" data-scheme="block" data-mode="icon-before" data-icon="spark">
          Quick responses
        </h4>
